# Getting started
Setup consists of:
- installing all dependencies with `yarn install` (requires `nodejs` and `yarn`). Alternatively `npm install` will also work.

## Compiling
Running the application requires compiling it. To compile the client-side stylesheets, use

```npm run stylesheets```.

## Running locally

To run the application, use the watchers. For the server

```npm run server``` (requires `nodemon` to be globally installed)

for the client

```npm run webpack```.
